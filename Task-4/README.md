Dataset used :
** Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset** . It contains features extracted from digitized images of breast tissue samples and labels them as Malignant (M) or Benign (B).

Main Goal:
To build and evaluate a Logistic Regression model for binary classification â€” predicting whether a tumor is malignant or benign.

What the Code Does:
   - Loads and cleans the dataset.
   - Splits the data.
   - Standardizes the features.
   - Trains a Logistic Regression model.
   - Evaluates the model using.
   - Tunes the classification threshold.
   - Explains and visualizes the Sigmoid function.
