What this project does:
This  ML project demonstrates how to build a simple linear regression model to predict house prices based on a single feature: the area (in square feet). It walks through the complete ML pipelineâ€”from loading data to evaluating model performance and visualizing results.

Main goals
- Understand the basics of supervised learning using regression
- Learn how to use Python libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib
- Train and evaluate a linear regression model
- Visualize the relationship between house area and price


Dataset used:
- House Price Prediction Dataset
It contains the features like:
  - Area
  - Price
  - no.of bathrooms
  - no.of bedrooms  etc.
